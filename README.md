# Energy Load Forecasts Project

# Developed predictive models trained on 2005 municipal hourly electricity load data and tested on 2006 data to bolster grid stability, enhance infrastructure planning, and enable better utilization of renewable energy sources.
# Harnessed the PyCaret Python ML library for streamlined model comparison, selection, and tuning, targeting optimal MAPEs.

# Goal 1: Created an hourly load forecasting model which would help utility companies purchase their energy needs using the day-ahead market rather than a real-time energy market. Achieved an MAPE of 6.18% with the LightGBM model selected by PyCaret.
# Goal 2: Created a daily peak load model and recorded an MAPE of 7.73% with the LightGBM model selected by PyCaret.
